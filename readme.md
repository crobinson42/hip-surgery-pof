## Summary

A total of 16hrs was spent bringing the prototype to this point. There are a few areas, 
if given more time, that I would polish features. My strategy from the start was getting 
the application code viable and extendable without much concern of styles and layout
since those can be fixed up quickly - I accomplished a clean project code layout 
from the start which will make any adjustments to the prototype easy once the client 
requests iterations on the prototype demo.

There were a few areas I spent more time than I liked. First, I developed in Chrome then 
checked the demo in Safari and needed to fix some cross-browser issues which ate up about 2hrs.
Second, I spent too much time trying to code the trig calculations for the teardop line & inklination 
angle and in the end I didn't get it finished, about 3-4hrs.

#### Completed Features
- Tested on iPad (Safari)
- User can retake multiple images
- User can invert colors
- Add and position teardrops
- Automatic teardrop line
- Teardrop line updates automatically when teardrops moving
- Input for target inklination angle
- Add inklination angle and drag to move along teardrop line
- Ability to zoom in and move (drag) teardrops w/ precision
- App works on landscape and portrait mode in iPad
 
#### Features To Finish (w/ time estimates)
- Match styles to prototype layout (1hr)
- Add logic w/ UI input to switch camera being used on iPad device ie: front/rear (1hr)
- Add trigonometry calculations for inklination angle to be acurate based on TD line (2hr)
- Add logic for inklination angle to "stick" to TD line when dragging position (2hr)
- Add button to flip left/right inklination angle (1hr)
